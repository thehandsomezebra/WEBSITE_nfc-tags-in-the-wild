# Finders Keepers - You now own this tag

Why did you scan a random nfc tag? I suppose I could lecture you on why that's a bad idea, but I'm not your mom. lol. Anyhow, finders keepers - this tag is yours now.



### Ideas for your new found tag

- Auto-connect to some wifi (because that password is just too hard to remember)
- Share some media (you can link to a picture of a [cat](https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/vJB8rwfdX.jpg) )
- Open a youtube video (here's a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) )
- Automate stuff in your home
- Set a timer for perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs
- Give your contact info to a new friend
- Link to your portfolio or LinkedIn
- ... or whatever else you can think of :)


### How do you program it?

There's lots of fancy ways to do it, but `NFC Tools` is my favorite to program these:
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749)
